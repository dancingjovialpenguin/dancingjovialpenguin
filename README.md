# *dancing jovial penguin*'s personal website

This is a quick overview of the tools I've used, the blogging process, and the navigation functionality of the website in addition to miscellaneous notes.

## Resources

While building this website and creating some of its graphics, I've used the following programs, all of which contain open-source excerpts though only Krita and Git explicitly claim to be free *(as in freedom)* software:

* Visual Studio Code (as a code editor)
* Krita (for drawing)
* Git (for version control)
* Neocities (to host the website and gain publicity)

## The blogging functionality

I write my blog posts on Google Documents. When I'm done and ready to share one with the public, I copy the entire writing, paste in into a new Markdown file (.md extension) in the top directory of the entire project, and edit the file to comply with Markdown syntax (`#` for h1, `##` for h2, etc.).

Later, I open the `md-to-html.py` file and set the `blog_name` variable to what the blog post is going to be titled. I run the Python file through the terminal, and the script generates a new HTML file in the `blogs/` directory with the Markdown content formatted within HTML elements.

Finally, I manually update the `index.html` file to list the blog post and upload the HTML file that contains the blog post and index page to Neocities. I delete the Markdown file, as it's no longer necessary.

## The navigation/section-switching functionality

This refers to the navigation bar in the index page of the website. While building this functionality, I didn't use JavaScript but a less conventional method with CSS solely. 

Exploiting the `~` operator (subsequent-sibling combinator) and `:target` pseudo-class in the CSS syntax and putting `#about`, the first section that appears when previewed, after all the sections in the source code of index made such an approach feasible.

## Notes

While the website is almost entirely open-source, only the first blog post I've published will remain tracked and committed for the sake of simplicity. I update the blog posts' writing every now and then, so I didn't want to fill my commit history with these updates.

Changes to stylesheets, scripts, and the index page will likely continue being committed, though not immediately after.
