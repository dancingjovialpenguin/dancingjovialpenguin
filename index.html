          <h3>my current obsessions</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Lana Del Rey:</b> My favorite singer and songwriter
              characterized by the melancholy, introspectiveness, and cinematic
              quality in her art. <i>Ultraviolence</i> is my favorite album from
              her.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Radical feminism:</b> The subset of feminism that aims to
              liberate women and marginalized communities from the patriarchy,
              the oppressive and entrenched system that benefits men and
              exploits other identities. It contrasts with
              <i>liberal feminism</i> and criticizes the systemic reality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Queer pride:</b> The movement of resistance against homophobia
              and celebration of diverse self-expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tuxedo Sam:</b> A fictional but very silly, cute, and
              fashionable penguin - the most unserious list item here. He's in
              the favicon, and he owns 365 bow ties!

              <p>
                <i>Hello!</i> I'm <i>dancing jovial penguin</i> (any pronouns), an
                introverted gay demimale teenager with a passion for computer
                science, activism, art, and analyzing my problems! This is my
                personal website. (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡
              </p>
            </div>

            <h4>A short background</h4>
            <p>
              I started creating this website on May 31st, 2025. I've had a long
              history of coding even as a teenager, so I've always loved web
              projects. The next day being Pride Month quite motivated me to
              produce something creative, and so I decided I would make a
              personal website like this hosted on Neocities. ヾ(≧∇≦)ゞ
            </p>

            <h4>Site sections</h4>
            <p>
              I write blog posts to express myself as I spend much of my time by
              myself contemplating about my life and those of others. They will
              probably be posted here, specifically at the
              <b>#blogs</b> section.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meantime, I find myself diverting from one topic of
              interest to another that I immerse myself into, so you can find
              what I'm currently fixating on at the <b>#obsessions</b> section.
              These interests are often what my blog posts are centered on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like going by nicknames, and I've had many different ones on the
              internet. As a huge fan of the letter J and penguins, the
              adjective <i>jovial</i> catched my eye, and I placed it within
              <i>dancing penguin</i> to describe myself despite being neither a
              cheerful dancer nor penguin. See my presence on other social apps
              at <b>#socials</b>.
            </p>

            <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
            <p>
              I'm feeling quite proud of myself for implementing the
              section-switching functionality by using solely CSS and not
              JavaScript. What I mean is the sidebar of this website, how you
              can navigate through it, and the consequential page changes.
              Maybe, it's already an obviously easy thing to do with CSS, but
              I'd never thought I could do it without any scripting. ヾ(｡･ω･)ｼ
            </p>
            <p>
              The background image, which is better visible on a computer? It's
              something I created on Krita, a free and open source software for
              drawing, in about 10 minutes. I wanted some graphics on my website
              rather than simply colors alone. I love the rain, so I thought it
              would make a pleasant background image despite how this instance
              was effortless to draw. (◕︿◕✿)
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, this website is currently a work in progress and, just
              like probably most other Neocities websites, looks better on a
              computer. Click on the Nyan Cat to toggle its animation play
              state. ♡ ♡ ♡
