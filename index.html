            <h1>dancing jovial penguin ♡</h1>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm dancing jovial penguin (any pronouns), an introverted
              gay demimale teenager with a passion for computer science,
              activism, art, and analyzing my problems!
            </p>
            <p>
              I started creating this website on May 31st, 2025. I've had a long
              history of coding even as a teenager, so I've always loved web
              projects. The next day being Pride Month quite motivated me to
              produce something creative, and so I decided I would make a
              personal website like this on Neocities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I plan on creating blogs to express myself as I spend much of my
              time by myself thinking deeply about my life and those of others.
              They will probably be put here, specifically at the #blogs
              section.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meanwhile, I find myself diverting from one topic of
              interest to another that I immerse myself into, so you can find
              what I'm currently fixating on at the #obsessions section.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like going by nicknames, and I've had lots of different ones on
              the internet. You can discover my presence on other social apps at
              #socials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from all that, I'm feeling quite proud of myself for having
              implemented the section-switching functionality by using solely
              CSS and not JavaScript. What I mean is the sidebar of this
              website, how you can navigate through it, and the consequential
              page changes. Maybe, it's already an obviously easy thing to do
              with CSS, but I'd never thought I could do it without any
              scripting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The background image (on a computer)? It's something I created on
              Krita, a free and open source software for drawing, in about 10
              minutes. I wanted some graphics on my website rather than simply
              colors alone. I love the rain, so I thought it would make a
              pleasant background image despite how this instance was effortless
              to draw.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, this website is currently a work in progress and, just
              like probably most other Neocities websites, looks better on a
              computer. Click on the Nyan Cat to toggle its animation play
              state. ♡ ♡ ♡
