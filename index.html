          <h3>my current obsessions</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Lana Del Rey:</b> My favorite singer and songwriter,
              characterized by the melancholy, introspectiveness, and cinematic
              quality in her art. <i>Ultraviolence</i> is my favorite album from
              her.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Radical feminism:</b> The subset of feminism that aims to
              liberate women and marginalized communities from the patriarchy,
              the oppressive and entrenched system that benefits men and
              exploits other identities. It contrasts with
              <i>liberal feminism</i> and criticizes the systemic reality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Queer pride:</b> The movement of resistance against homophobia
              and celebration of diverse self-expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tuxedo Sam:</b> A fictional but very silly, cute, and
              fashionable penguin - the most unserious list item here. He's in
              the favicon, and he owns 365 bow ties!

              <p>
                <i>Hello!</i> I'm <i>dancing jovial penguin</i> (any pronouns),
                an introverted gay demimale teenager with a passion for computer
                science, activism, art, and analyzing my problems! This is my
                personal website. (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡
              </p>
            </div>

            <h4>A short background</h4>
            <p>
              I created this website on May 31st, 2025. I've had a long history
              of coding even as a teenager, so I've always loved crafting on the
              web. The next day signalling the start of Pride Month motivated me
              to produce something creative, so I decided I would make a
              personal website hosted on Neocities for free. ヾ(≧∇≦)ゞ
            </p>

            <h4>Site sections</h4>
            <p>
              I write blog posts to express myself as I spend much of my time by
              myself contemplating about various things. They will probably be
              posted here, specifically at the
              <b>#blogs</b> section.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meantime, I find myself diverting from one topic of
              interest to another that I immerse myself into, so you can find
              what I'm currently fixating on at the <b>#obsessions</b> section.
              These interests are often what my blog posts are centered on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like going by nicknames, and I've had different ones on the
              internet. As a huge fan of the letter J and penguins, the
              adjective <i>jovial</i> catched my eye, and I placed it within
              <i>dancing penguin</i> to describe myself despite being neither a
              cheerful dancer nor penguin. See my presence on other social apps
              at <b>#socials</b>.
            </p>

            <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
            <p>
              The section-switching functionality of this website was
              implemented solely by CSS - the sidebar of this website, how you
              can navigate through it, and the consequential page changes.
              ヾ(｡･ω･)ｼ
            </p>
            <p>
              The background image, which is better visible on a computer? It's
              something I created on Krita, a free and open source software for
              drawing, in about 10 minutes. I wanted some graphics on my website
              rather than simply colors alone. I love the rain, so I thought it
              would make a pleasant background image. I admit how effortless it
              was to draw this instance though. (◕︿◕✿)
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, this website is mobile-friendly - though I think, just
              like probably most other websites on Neocities, it looks better on
              a computer. Click on the Nyan Cat to toggle its animation play
              state. ♡♡♡

                They said that love was enough, but it wasn't.<br />
                The earth shattered, the sky opened.<br />
                The rain was fire, but we were wooden.<br />
