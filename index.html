          <h3>my current obsessions</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Lana Del Rey:</b> My favorite singer and songwriter,
              characterized by the melancholy, introspectiveness, and cinematic
              quality in her art. <i>Ultraviolence</i> is my favorite album from
              her.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Radical feminism:</b> The subset of feminism that aims to
              liberate women and marginalized communities from the patriarchy,
              the oppressive and entrenched system that benefits men and
              exploits other identities. It contrasts with
              <i>liberal feminism</i> and criticizes the systemic reality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Queer pride:</b> The movement of resistance against homophobia
              and celebration of diverse self-expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tuxedo Sam:</b> A fictional but very silly, cute, and
              fashionable penguin - the most unserious list item here. He's in
              the favicon, and he owns 365 bow ties!

            <p>
              <i>Hello!</i> I'm <i>dancing jovial penguin</i> (any pronouns), an
              introverted gay demiboy teenager with a passion for computer
              science, activism, art, and analyzing my problems! This is my
              personal website. (¬¥ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ œâ ‚Ä¢ÔΩ°`) ‚ô°
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4>a short background ‚ùÄÀñ¬∞.</h4>
          <p>
            On May 31st, 2025 I created this website. I've always loved crafting
            on the web with my long (or at least <i>intensive</i>) history of
            coding even as a teenager. The next day would signal the beginning
            of Pride Month, so that motivated me to put my creativity into work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having found out about Neocities while scrolling on Pinterest, I
            thought it was appealing because of the residing websites' abundance
            of self-expression and its ability to host websites for free while
            listing it among many others. Finally, I decided I would make a
            personal website like this and host it on Neocities. „Éæ(‚âß‚àá‚â¶)„Çû
          </p>

          <h4>what awaits you ‚ãÜ. êôö Ãä</h4>
          <p>
            I write out blog posts when I feel the urge to express my thoughts
            and feelings. They lie in the <b>#blogs</b> section. I usually enjoy
            contemplation about random topics or analyzing what at a specific
            moment concerns me or other people, so my blog posts might reflect
            these processes, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, I divert from one topic of interest to another,
            which I try to immerse myself into. Find what I'm currently fixating
            on in <b>#obsessions.</b> Blog posts are central to creating the
            content of this website, so these interests, which I call
            obsessions, rightfully manifest themselves in #blogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a huge fan of the letter J and penguins, I hopped on the lookout
            for adjectives starting with J, and <i>jovial</i> caught my eye.
            Despite being neither a penguin nor a cheerful dancer, I placed this
            adjective within <i>dancing penguin</i> to describe myself - the
            emergence of an online alias. I do love nicknames! See my other
            presence on various platforms in
            <b>#socials.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            On the bottom of every section lies a tiny purple Lana Del Rey
            lyric. Could I be worshipping her? Refrain from judging me for
            what's written here - it's understandable, yes, but I often get
            insecure! „Éæ(ÔΩ°ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)ÔΩº
          </p>

          <h4>miscellaneous final thoughts ‚ÇäÀö‚äπ ·∞î</h4>
          <h5>a little fun fact</h5>
          <p>
            Section-switching in this website was solely coded in CSS - the
            sidebar, how one can navigate through it, and the consequential page
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fear there's no one specific reason for why I value this specific
            piece of information - regardless, nothing could stop me, obviously.
            In some online developer hangouts, I've seen the celebration of CSS
            implementations of certain functionalities where JS would be
            conventionally preferred. That had an impact.
          </p>
          <h5>the background image?</h5>
          <p>
            Better visible on a computer, the background image is something I've
            created on Krita in about 10 minutes or less. Krita is a free and
            open-source software for drawing, and it's lovely, so why not give
            it a chance and support it?
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted some graphics on my website rather than the plain pink,
            blue, and green alone. I love the rain, so why wouldn't it make a
            pleasant background image? Though, this instance was effortless to
            draw - I must admit.
          </p>
          <h5>farewell</h5>
          <p>
            The very final thought is that this website is mobile-friendly!
            Click the proud Nyan cat to toggle its animation play state and
            transparency level. It might still be somewhat distracting, so my
            apologies. (‚óïÔ∏ø‚óï‚úø)
