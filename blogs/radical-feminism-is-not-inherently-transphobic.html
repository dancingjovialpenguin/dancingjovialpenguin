    <h1>Radical feminism is not inherently transphobic</h1>
    <p>
      Trans-exclusive and gender-critical radical feminists (TERFs) often claim
      that radical feminism doesn't fight for transgender women while
      perpetuating transphobic narratives and invalidating transgender people's
      experiences and identities. In addition to their exclusive ideology, the
      large frequency of these "feminists" in online spaces, probably driven by
      some well-known figures like J.K. Rowling, have worsened the reputation of
      radical feminism overall. Nevertheless, one could theorize that TERFs are
      a small minority of "radical feminists" considering the explicit mention
      of the "trans-exclusive" label.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radical feminism aims to dismantle the patriarchy, the deeply rooted
      system of dominance and control over those who are deemed inferior,
      including cisgender women and other marginalized communities. Gender
      essentialism, the basis for the patriarchy, normalizes the suffering women
      go through by asserting that their biological features are what defines
      their roles in society and makes them submit to men's rule. Radical
      feminism must inherently be supportive of the gender and sex dichotomy against essentialism, as
      it clearly identifies the distinction between the social and cultural
      expectations, norms, and traits (gender) that are placed on women's bodies
      (sex) to keep them in control and serve men's desires and the fact that there is no natural link
      between the two concepts. Here I share my interpretation of radical
      feminism that includes transgender people by different concepts.
    </p>
    <h2>Gender identity</h2>
    <p>
      Gender identity, where a person sees themselves aligned within gender, is
      developed by gendered socialization during childhood, meaning that we
      internalize the gender norms that our parents, peers, and teachers
      perpetuate. As a result of this deep internalization, we are inclined not
      to break the norms associated with our gender identity, and gender
      identity becomes an intensely felt aspect of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a woman feels like a woman because she has been raised by
      gender norms relating to femininity and internalized them. It's obvious
      that transgender women's socializations greatly differ from those of
      cisgender men (and likewise for transgender men), as no cisgender men would
      sincerely claim that they feel like a woman. I feel like this is the point
      that many TERFs tend to miss. It's not all about the attitudes of parents
      or others that perpetuate gender norms toward children (Some transgender
      women have even been directly told to avoid behaving in a feminine
      manner.) but also about how the child internalizes those norms creating
      their gender identity. Thus, transgender women don't experience "male
      socialization," or transgender men "female socialization."
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum it up, the patriarchy's tool of oppression, gender as we name it
      separately from sex, is perpetuated in a very real way as a result of
      gendered socialization, and transgender people socialize in a way similarly to
      their opposite sex-assigned-at-birth does. Transgender women are indeed
      women, transgender men are indeed men, both by socialization like in how
      cisgender women and men are, and the terms "women" and "men" are socially
      constructed.
    </p>
    <h2>Conformity to gender norms</h2>
    <p>
      TERFs often point out that transgender people reinforce gender roles, but
      actually, everyone does. Everyone feels an inclination to submit to gender
      norms, as gender plays an intense role in society. Our likes, tastes, and
      choices have simply been influenced by the patriarchy, as we are living
      under it. Transgender people comply with gender norms as much as cisgender
      people do. Transgender women can also have internalized misogyny, just
      like cisgender women can. In addition, transgender women and men are not
      women and men because of gender norms, but rather, because of their gender
      identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical transition transgender people go through has often been hinted
      at. Transgender people feel like they have the wrong body, and that
      feeling stems from their neurobiology. Even in a genderless society,
      transgender people will exist and will have to medically transition.
    </p>
    <h2>Ending thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      The patriarchy is built on the idea of gender in how we analyze it, so
      most radical feminists are supportive of gender abolition, which means
      that everyone will be freed from oppression on the basis of different
      norms and roles that are assigned based on our biological aspects. Surely,
      the exploitation of women's reproduction, more reliant on
      sex-assigned-at-birth, cannot be ignored, and it is another focus of
      radical feminism while identifying the areas of oppression. In a
      genderless society, everyone will be able to freely express themselves,
      perform whatever roles they want to without coercion, and women and other
      marginalized communities will no longer be oppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women's oppression is strongly tied to the oppression of other
      marginalized communities. The LGBTQ+ community faces oppression as it
      challenges the patriarchy by promoting the gender and sex dichotomy. Gay
      men are discriminated against because romantic and sexual attraction to
      men is related to femininity, and being a woman is seen as the worst, an
      inferior thing to be under the patriarchy, while lesbians are blamed for
      not being "feminine" enough, so the patriarchy is tackled in oppressing
      them. Transgender and non-binary people directly challenge gender roles by
      not conforming to those of their sex-assigned-at-birth and the
      patriarchy's gender essentialist ideas. For this reason, radical feminism
      is intersectional as the patriarchy oppresses other marginalized
      communities in a similar way to cisgender heterosexual women, and it's
      necessary that we include transgender people, who are actively resisting
      the patriarchy.
