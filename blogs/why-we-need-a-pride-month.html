          <h1>Why we need a Pride Month</h1>
          <h4>
            TRIGGER WARNING: violence, sexual assault, rape, social exclusion,
            homophobia, conservativity, and castration
          </h4>
          <p>
            Often loathed by conservatives, Pride Month refers to the month
            where the LGBTQ+ community comes together to celebrate their
            diversity and non-conformance to the heteronormative patriarchy.
            Coming from a gay teenager, here are some reasons why we need such a
            month from a personal vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming out, to me, is how I express and finally free myself from the
            assumption that everyone is straight. In a society where being
            straight is the default, I feel invalidated and misunderstood. You
            would not like it if everyone thought of something that was false
            about you. Yet, it's not the easiest thing ever to just step in and
            say, "I am gay!" No one wants to risk social exclusion, so you end
            up with deep suffering and an annoying questioning of your identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I face a higher risk of violence just because I'm gay
            <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. On top of the statistics, add the fact
            that my reports of violence are more likely to be taken not
            seriously because of homophobia, and consider how we are afraid to
            report violence because we might struggle with social exclusion and
            hatred.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a risk of rejection by my family if they found out that I was
            gay, so I have to hide it. It's not the best experience to disguise
            a part of your identity from your closest ones who raised you.
            They'll assume you develop crushes on the opposite gender, marry one
            in the future, and try to impress them, but no, you're not even
            close to that - that's not you. If my family ever heard of my sexual
            orientation, maybe I'd get disowned or tried to be convinced that's
            not me or how they raised me. Even the most "progressive" families
            might struggle accepting their children when they find out their
            child is "one of them."
          </p>
          <p>
            Some countries still give the death penalty to homosexuality
            <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't get married to someone I love in the future if I wanted to
            as my country and many others haven't legalized gay marriage
            <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>, while my straight counterparts can,
            without this fundamental struggle. Being gay is frowned upon and
            seen as a disorder when you're not even particularly hurting anyone
            or yourself, but the society is explicitly hating you for something
            you neither chose to be nor had control over - sexual and romantic
            attraction. It feels painful in many ways to be misunderstood and
            having your reality denied. You cannot express who you like, have
            romantic interactions with another gay person, display public
            affection, like hold hands or kiss, or have your relationship
            legalized with benefits through marriage, while straight people
            hardly experience any of these challenges because of their identity,
            because they are straight.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Conversion therapy" is ineffective and brings with it a risk of
            suicide, and in some cases, rape to convert the person
            <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>. No, you cannot change someone's sexual
            orientation. Sexual orientation can only change on its own if it
            ever does. No one will choose to be gay, especially in a homophobic
            society, and deny their feelings of attraction - it's at best a
            harmless journey of exploration. You can't "promote homosexuality."
          </p>
          <p>
            One example, Alan Turing, the father of computers, was arrested for
            confessing to a police officer that he'd had a relationship with
            another man, and later, he was provided chemical castration and
            ended up committing suicide <a href="#ref-5">[5]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gay people have always existed throughout history. Back then, it was
            harder to live as a gay person, so most had to hide it. As more
            people started existing and a growing awareness and acceptance of
            the LGBTQ+ community emerged, we are finally seeing more people come
            out as they wish to.
          </p>
          <p>
            To sum it all up, the Pride Month exists because the LGBTQ+
            community faces hatred, violence, assault, and rejection because of
            who they are, and this month is how we display our resistance
            against homophobia and spread validation, representation, and a
            sense of solidarity to help other LGBTQ+ people feel valid and at
            terms with their identity. Having focused on my own, relatively
            privileged experiences, I emphasize that one must be aware that some
            communities have it worse, and oppression is intersectional. Trans
            people, people of color, and women all have their oppressions
            combined with multiple parts of their identities. It's important
            that we all are united against hatred, heteronormativity, and the
            patriarchy.
